1) Enter the correct directory with

	cd ~/opt/AR.TE/acqu_user

2) Edit 'data/Server-TaggEff.dat' to ensure you're analyzing the correct data
file.  At the moment there are two sets of three runs.  We have already done
31833, 31834, and 31835, but you can try 31884, 31885, and 31886 next.
Unfortunately, you need to run them individually, run by run.

3) Run AcquRoot using the command 

	../build/bin/AcquRoot Offline-TaggEff.dat

The two background runs should be super quick, but the actual tagging
efficiency run might take a few minutes to run.  The output should be in the
directory 'ARout' and for each run consists of a histogram file (ARHist) and
an output file needed by a2GoAT (Acqu).

4) Go to the GoAT directory with

	cd ~/opt/a2G.TE

5) For each of the Acqu output files (not the histogram files), run the command

	build/bin/TaggEff configfiles/NewTaggEff-Recabled.dat -f ARout/Acqu_TaggEff_<run#>.root -F out/goat_<run#>.root

where you of course replace the <run#> with the actual run number.  The output
files should be written to the 'out' directory.

6) Now you run the macro TE.C on the a2GoAT output in a ROOT session.  Start
ROOT like you always do, load the macro and then run the method TE with the
name strings of the three a2GoAT output files:

	.L TE.C
	TE( "out/goat_31834.root", "out/goat_31833.root", "out/goat_31835.root")

Make sure you put the main tagging efficiency run first, and then background
run 1 (before) and background run 2 (after).

This will produce and output file, also in the "out" directory, called
"ExpBkgSub_<run#>.root" where the run number is given by the main tagging
efficiency run, and not the background runs.

You should then be able to open this file in ROOT and view the output!
